Assets will be delivered in our world.

an Asset can have multiple fields like:

	-ID (monotinaclly increasing identifier)
	-value (private field - only factory and retailer should know about this).
	-quantity (private field - only factory and retailer should know about this)
	-owner (who owns the asset - factory or retailer).
	-state (CREATED,PENDING,DELIVERED,DISFUNCTIONAL,LOST)
	-type (e.g Car,Marble,Commercial_paper)
	-currtime(when transaction took place)
	-estimated_arrival_time (used when the asset is in transportation)
	-delay (how much it is delayed from initial estimated_arival_time) #delay is changed by courier or by retailer-factory at arrival time.
	-location (where the asset is located now - factory or retailer or where does it came from)
	-what facotry produced the asset? (kind of the same as above)
	-destination (what's the dest of the asset)


smart contracts methods:

	1)addAsset(): Only factory calls this method.Creates an asset with delivery times nil and state=CREATED.
	2)deliver() :Only courier can call this method. Sets new state=PENDDING , estimated_time , delay=0 and location statys the same.
	3)changeDeliveryTime(): Only courier can call this .Sets only estimated_time by increasing or decreasing it(usually decreasing).
	Asset must be in PENDING state or this method return err.
	4) transfer(): changes ownership from factory to retailer or vice versa.
	5)sendBack() : called by retailer when asset is in bad condition and wants to send it back to factory. called from state=DELIVERED and state changes to
	state=DISFUNCTIONAL. 


2 ORGS:
		When we wave two orgs (factory & retailer) there is no private data and all transactions need to be endorsed by both orgs.
3 ORGS:
	->	addAsset() and sendBack() set and change the value of 'value' field so they should be enodrsed ONLY by factory and retailer .
	-> Other methods should be endorsed by all of them.		


Courier is monitoring the blockchain and sees when an asset is CREATED by factory. Then the courier calls deliver() to transport the asset to the destination.
Courier is monitoring the blockchain and sees when an asset is DISFUNCTIONAL by retailer. Then the ccourier calls deliver() to transport the asset back to the factory.
Retailer is monitoring the blockchain in order to manage inventory.
Factory is monitoring in order to control production because of DIFUNCTIONAL or LOST assets.

											USEFUL SCENARIO
											~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the application of each node, each party can monitor the blockchain and manage inventory. If an asset A1 is delayed then the inventory may be overflow because
other assets will come by after A1. So, the retailer should stop making further transactions to ensure that storage will sufficient space or the retailer should make 
the same transaction but with fewer quantities for each asset. 
In the factory case, the factory should stop producing further assets if it sees that retailer don't make many transactions or if many assets are DISFUNCTIONAL.
In the courier case, if all vehicles are full and hence delay increases, then it should deploy more vehicles.

advantages:
	-consumers can learn about the process of creation and useful facts about the product.
	-better monitoring by all the participants - not just RFID but exact schedule of transportation and CHANGES can be recorded.(inventory managing)
	-retailer can learn if product passed the certification tests.
	-Ensuring quantities and products to be delivered are the right ones.For example, if a transaction was made on a phone call, then mistakes could be made.
	-Fraud detection. The supplier is shady (you dont know where the goods are coming from - one supplier is delegation work to sub-suplliers - supplier can
	cooke the books to charge you more e.g. lie to you about the shipping schedule of a product)
	-YOU CANT TRACK EVERYONE
